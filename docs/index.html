                    <p>With a passion for journalism and writing I love to create compelling narratives and educative art. My curiosity for new knowledge and experiences allows them to create travelling and learning into a hobby allowing me to create interesting documentaries of my experiences. I am constantly learning new things and sharing my experiences in and outside of media whether it is through blogs, websites and social media or story telling which widens my communicative and social abilities. My work not only reflects my dedication to excellence in journalism but also showcases my skills in research, digital media, and audience engagement. I strive to inform, inspire, and influence, making significant contributions to the field of media and communication.</p>

My creative skills and passion for designing allow me to create aesthetic pieces in the media which are both engaging and fun. My skills in various design tools and technologies, coupled with a understanding of contemporary visual trends, allows me to deliver projects that consistently exceed expectations. I have had many experiences with not only technological design like platforms and media, but I have also created featured merch and posters during my work experience in Barbican Theatre. I strive to provide a fun, aesthetic workspace mentored to personal preference for all. </p>

This has formed a newfound zeal for Biology, especially in its application to environmental science, that allows me to investigate new ways for sustaining natural habitats and preserving biodiversity. My dedication to making a tangible difference has guided me to training with Padi scuba diving to equip me with a scuba diving qualification that tested my resilience and hard-working ethos, but now allows me to explore and contribute to the conservation of the underwater world. I am eager to apply my skills and insights to advance sustainability initiatives and promote a healthier planet.</p>
